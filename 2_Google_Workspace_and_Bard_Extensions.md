## Drive & Docs

`Prompt`

@Google Drive give me short summary of the story in the Google Doc titled "puppy_story"

`Response`

In the story "puppy_story", Maisie, a little girl who lives in a cozy cottage, dreams of having a furry friend with paws instead of whiskers. One day, she stumbles upon a dusty, old trunk in the attic and finds a faded photograph of her grandmother with a ball of golden fur cradled in her arms. The inscription on the back reads, "Sunny, the sunshine of my life". Maisie becomes determined to get a puppy of her own and visits her Grandma Clara. Grandma Clara takes Maisie to her apple orchard and shows her three bundles of golden fur. One puppy, with eyes like melted caramel and a splash of white on his chest, catches Maisie's gaze. She scoops him up and names him Sunny. Sunny becomes Maisie's best friend and fills her days with joy and laughter.
